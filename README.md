# my-first-pr

A place to practice your first opensource PR

# Background

PRs (aka, pul requests) to opensource projects are the lifeblood of the opensource community. It is how it is possible for free software to be free, by aggregating the small contributions of dozens of people into ine product.

In addition to being good for the community, it is also a key way for developers to showcase rheir skills and capabilities to employers. PRs allow you to:

- Create a portfolio of contributions to known projects
- Showcase your ability to work well with others, particularly in receiving criticism
- Show that you are able to be more than a code monkey.

Hiring someone, particularly for their first job, is very risky for an employer. It can take 90-180 days for a new hire (experienced or not) to become a net positive member of a team and between 18 and 24 months to be a profitable member of a team. This is a large risk.  Opensource contributions de-risk you as a choice.
